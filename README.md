# **House Price Prediction**
This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The dataset includes various house features, but only the relevant ones are used for this model.

The model is implemented in Streamlit. To use the model, simply run App.py make predictions. Detailed code and scripts are included in the Prodigy_ML_01.ipynb.
